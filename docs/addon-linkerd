# linkerd

Enabling this addon will deploy the necessary services and proxies for the
linkerd service mesh. To use linkerd effectively it is also required to set up
and configure the `linkerd` CLI utility.

```bash
microk8s.enable linkerd
```

The [linkerd documentation][linkerd-docs] suggests the following for installing
the command line tool:

```bash
curl -sL https://run.linkerd.io/install | sh
```

You should also make sure the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable is set to point
to the MicroK8s config file:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=$KUBECONFIG:/snap/microk8s/current/client.config
```

You can verify that linkerd is operating by running:

```bash
linkerd check
```

For more on general usage for linkerd, see the
[linkerd documentation][linkerd-docs].
