# linkerd

Enabling this addon will deploy the necessary services and proxies for the
linkerd service mesh.

```bash
microk8s.enable linkerd
```

Linkerd includes a command line utility. For convenience, MicroK8s ships
with this utility. You can verify that the utility and linkerd are
configured and working by running:

```bash
microk8s.linkerd check
```

For more on linkerd, see the
[linkerd documentation][linkerd-docs].
